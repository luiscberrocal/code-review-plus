# Code Review Plus Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Pluggable Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The system MUST support a plugin-based architecture that allows third-party extensions for 
code analysis rules, report formats, and integrations. All plugins MUST follow standardized 
interfaces with clear contracts. Core functionality SHALL remain independent of specific 
plugins. Plugin discovery and loading must be automatic and configurable. Plugin isolation 
required to prevent failures from affecting core operations.

**Rationale**: Extensibility is critical for adapting to diverse development environments, 
technologies, and organizational standards. A rigid system cannot scale to meet varied 
code review requirements across different teams and projects.

### II. CLI-First Design
Primary interface MUST be command-line with comprehensive argument support, configuration 
file options, and pipeline integration capabilities. All functionality accessible via CLI 
commands following Unix philosophy: do one thing well, composable operations, text-based 
input/output. Support both interactive and batch modes. Exit codes must follow standard 
conventions for CI/CD integration.

**Rationale**: CLI tools integrate seamlessly into development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, 
and automation scripts. GUI interfaces are secondary to ensuring maximum compatibility 
and automation potential.

### III. Rule-Based Analysis  
All code analysis MUST be driven by configurable rules with clear precedence hierarchies 
(global → project → local overrides). Rules must be declarative, version-controlled, and 
shareable across teams. Support for rule inheritance, composition, and conditional 
application based on file types, directories, or project characteristics. Rule violations 
must include severity levels and remediation guidance.

**Rationale**: Consistent, configurable standards ensure predictable code review outcomes 
while allowing customization for different projects and organizational requirements.

### IV. Comprehensive Reporting
Generate detailed, actionable reports through pluggable format providers supporting 
markdown, HTML, JSON, XML, and plain text outputs. Reports MUST include severity 
classifications, violation details, remediation suggestions, trend analysis, and compliance 
metrics. Report format plugins must be configurable and extensible to support custom 
organizational templates and branding. Support for report aggregation across multiple 
analysis runs. Integration with external reporting systems via standardized formats.

**Rationale**: Effective code review tools provide clear insights for developers, managers, 
and compliance teams. Pluggable report formats ensure seamless integration with existing 
documentation workflows and organizational standards.

### V. Code Quality Standards
Enforce industry best practices for linting, test coverage, security scanning, performance 
analysis, and documentation completeness. Support for multiple programming languages with 
language-specific rules and analyzers. Integration with existing tools (ruff, pytest, 
bandit, etc.) while providing unified configuration and reporting interface.

**Rationale**: Code quality is multifaceted requiring coordinated analysis across multiple 
dimensions. Unified tooling reduces configuration complexity and provides holistic 
quality assessment.

### VI. Pluggable Notification Architecture
The system MUST support configurable notification delivery through pluggable providers 
including email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, webhooks, and custom integrations. Notification 
content must be templatable with support for different message formats per channel. 
Notification triggers must be rule-based with filtering by severity, project, or analysis 
results. Rate limiting, retry mechanisms, and failure handling required for all notification 
providers. Sensitive information must be filtered from notifications with configurable 
content policies.

**Rationale**: Automated notifications ensure timely awareness of code review results 
across distributed teams. Pluggable architecture accommodates diverse communication 
preferences and organizational policies while maintaining security and reliability.

## Plugin Architecture Standards

All plugins MUST implement standardized interfaces with version compatibility declarations. 
Plugin metadata must include supported file types, dependencies, configuration schema, 
and output format specifications. Plugins SHALL NOT directly modify core system behavior 
or access unauthorized resources. Sandboxing and resource limits required for third-party 
plugins to ensure system stability and security.

Plugin distribution through package managers with signed packages and dependency validation. 
Plugin marketplace with rating, review, and compatibility verification systems to ensure 
quality and security of third-party extensions.

## Configuration Management

Configuration follows hierarchical precedence: command-line arguments → environment variables 
→ project config files → user config files → system defaults. Configuration files must 
use standardized formats (TOML, YAML, JSON) with schema validation. Support for configuration 
templates, inheritance, and environment-specific overrides.

Notification and reporting configuration must support provider-specific settings with 
secure credential management. Template configuration for reports and notifications must 
be version-controlled with validation against schema definitions. Channel-specific 
formatting rules and content filtering policies must be configurable per deployment 
environment.

All configuration changes must be auditable with version tracking and rollback capabilities. 
Sensitive configuration (API keys, credentials, notification tokens) handled through secure 
secret management with encryption at rest and in transit.

## Governance

This constitution defines the architectural and quality principles for Code Review Plus. 
All feature development must demonstrate compliance with these principles. Plugin 
compatibility requires adherence to defined interfaces and standards. Breaking changes 
to core interfaces require major version increments and migration documentation.

Code reviews must verify plugin interface compliance, configuration schema adherence, 
report format consistency, and notification delivery reliability. Performance benchmarks 
required for all analysis operations with regression testing for optimization changes. 
Security reviews mandatory for plugin interfaces, external integrations, and notification 
channels.
