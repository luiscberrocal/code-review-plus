# Feature Specification: Rule Violation Reporting System

**Feature Branch**: `002-rule-violation-reporting`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Rule violation reporting system that provides structured feedback with category, rule name, severity levels, pass/fail status, clear messages, and detailed information"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Rule Violation Detection (Priority: P1)

As a developer running code analysis, I want to receive structured feedback when my code violates project rules, so that I understand exactly what needs to be fixed and how to fix it.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables any rule-based analysis system to provide actionable feedback to developers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single rule check against code that violates that rule and verifying the returned violation object contains all required fields with correct values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Python file with a function missing type hints, **When** the type annotation rule is executed, **Then** a rule violation object is returned with category="type_safety", rule_name="missing_type_hints", severity="warning", passed=false, message="Function 'calculate_total' is missing type hints", and details containing the function name and line number
2. **Given** a Python file that passes all enabled rules, **When** rule analysis is executed, **Then** rule violation objects are returned with passed=true for each successful rule check
3. **Given** a code file with multiple violations of the same rule, **When** the rule is executed, **Then** separate violation objects are returned for each instance with unique details

---

### User Story 2 - Severity-Based Rule Filtering (Priority: P2)

As a developer or CI/CD system, I want to filter rule violations by severity level, so that I can prioritize critical issues and allow builds to pass with minor warnings.

**Why this priority**: Enables practical workflow integration where different severity levels can be handled differently (fail builds vs. show warnings).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running rules that generate different severity levels and verifying that filtering by severity returns only the expected violations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code with violations of different severities (info, warning, error, critical), **When** filtering for only "error" and "critical" violations, **Then** only violations with those severity levels are returned
2. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline configured to fail on "error" or higher, **When** code has only "warning" violations, **Then** the pipeline continues successfully
3. **Given** a mixed set of violations, **When** requesting "critical" only, **Then** violation objects with severity="critical" are returned with passed=false

---

### User Story 3 - Detailed Violation Context (Priority: P3)

As a developer fixing code violations, I want detailed context information in violation reports, so that I can quickly locate and understand the specific issue without additional investigation.

**Why this priority**: Improves developer experience and reduces time to resolution, but not essential for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering violations in different contexts and verifying that the details field contains location-specific and rule-specific information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a violation in a specific file and line, **When** the violation is reported, **Then** the details field contains file path, line number, column number, and code snippet context
2. **Given** a rule violation with available fixes, **When** the violation is reported, **Then** the details field includes suggested remediation steps or code examples
3. **Given** violations in imported modules vs. local code, **When** violations are reported, **Then** the details field clearly distinguishes the source location and provides appropriate context

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a rule fails to execute due to syntax errors or missing dependencies?
- How does the system handle rules that produce no violations (all checks pass)?
- What occurs when violation details exceed reasonable size limits?
- How are circular dependencies between rules handled?
- What happens when a rule produces violations but cannot determine specific location information?
