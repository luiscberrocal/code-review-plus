# Research: Rule Validation Reporting System

**Feature**: 003-rule-validation-reporting  
**Date**: October 12, 2025

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Enhance Existing RulesResult vs. Create New Schema
**Rationale**: Enhancing the existing RulesResult maintains backward compatibility while adding new capabilities. This approach requires zero code changes for existing usage patterns and allows gradual migration to enhanced features.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Create completely new ValidationResult schema: Would require extensive refactoring
- Extend RulesResult with inheritance: Would complicate type handling and serialization
- Create separate validation module: Would fragment validation logic across codebase

### Decision: Standardized Severity Enum vs. Flexible String
**Rationale**: Standardized enum ("info", "warning", "error", "critical") ensures consistent filtering, reporting, and CI/CD integration. Replaces the current flexible "level" field with a controlled vocabulary.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep flexible string field: Would continue current inconsistency issues
- Use numeric severity levels: Would reduce human readability
- Custom severity hierarchy: Would increase complexity without significant benefit

### Decision: Add Category Field for Rule Grouping
**Rationale**: Logical categorization (type_safety, security, performance, etc.) enables filtered reporting, focused analysis, and better organization of validation results.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Use rule name prefixes: Would require parsing and be less explicit
- Separate categorization service: Would complicate the simple schema approach
- No categorization: Would continue current limitation of flat rule organization

### Decision: Enhanced Details Field Structure
**Rationale**: Structured details with location information, remediation guidance, and context enable actionable feedback for developers to quickly resolve issues.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate location and remediation fields: Would complicate schema with multiple optional fields
- Keep simple string details: Would limit structured processing capabilities
- Use nested objects for details: Would complicate serialization and backward compatibility

### Decision: Integration with Coverage Handlers
**Rationale**: Adding validation function to existing coverage/handlers.py leverages current module structure and provides logical placement for coverage-related rule validation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create separate validation module: Would fragment coverage logic
- Add to main schemas module: Would mix validation logic with data definitions
- Create new coverage validation submodule: Would add unnecessary complexity for single function

## Implementation Approach

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- Maintain all existing fields in RulesResult
- Add new fields as optional with sensible defaults
- Ensure existing constructors continue working
- Provide migration utilities for enhanced usage

### Testing Strategy
- Property-based testing with hypothesis for validation logic
- Compatibility tests ensuring existing code continues working
- Integration tests with coverage analysis workflow
- Performance tests for large validation result sets

### Integration Points
- Coverage handlers for coverage-specific rule validation
- Existing plugin system for extensible validation rules
- Reporting system for enhanced output formatting
- CI/CD workflows for severity-based filtering
