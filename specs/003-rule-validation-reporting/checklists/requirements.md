# Specification Quality Checklist: Rule Validation Reporting System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [Rule Validation Reporting System](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for clarification or planning phase
- Enhanced RulesResult object structure is clearly defined with backward compatibility
- User scenarios focus on improving existing functionality while maintaining compatibility
- Success criteria emphasize both enhancement and backward compatibility
- Specification properly distinguishes between "validation results" and "violations" based on passed=false condition
