# Feature Specification: Rule Validation Reporting System

**Feature Branch**: `003-rule-validation-reporting`  
**Created**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Rule validation reporting system that provides structured feedback with category, rule name, severity levels, pass/fail status, clear messages, and detailed information, improving the existing RulesResult object"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Rule Validation Feedback (Priority: P1)

As a developer running code analysis, I want to receive structured validation feedback that clearly categorizes rules and provides standardized severity levels, so that I can quickly understand the type and importance of each rule check result.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that transforms the existing basic RulesResult into a comprehensive validation system with proper categorization and standardized severity handling.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single rule check and verifying the returned validation object contains category, standardized severity levels, and all required fields with correct values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Python file with missing type hints, **When** the type safety rule is executed, **Then** a rule validation object is returned with category="type_safety", name="missing_type_hints", severity="warning", passed=false, message="Function 'calculate_total' is missing type hints", and details containing remediation guidance
2. **Given** a Python file that passes all style rules, **When** code style validation is executed, **Then** rule validation objects are returned with category="code_style", passed=true, and positive confirmation messages
3. **Given** code with security vulnerabilities, **When** security rules are executed, **Then** validation objects are returned with category="security", severity="critical", passed=false, and detailed explanations

### User Story 2 - Severity-Based Validation Filtering (Priority: P2)

As a CI/CD system or developer, I want to filter rule validation results by severity level using standardized values, so that I can handle different severity levels appropriately (fail builds on errors vs. show warnings).

**Why this priority**: Enables practical workflow integration by providing consistent severity levels that different systems can rely on for decision-making.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running rules that generate different severity levels and verifying that filtering by severity returns only the expected validation results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code with validation results of different severities (info, warning, error, critical), **When** filtering for only "error" and "critical" results, **Then** only validation objects with those severity levels are returned
2. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline configured to fail on "error" or higher, **When** code has only "warning" validation results, **Then** the pipeline continues successfully with passed=true for warnings
3. **Given** validation results where passed=false, **When** requesting only failed validations, **Then** only validation objects with passed=false are considered violations

---

### User Story 3 - Rule Categorization and Context (Priority: P3)

As a developer analyzing code quality, I want rule validation results organized by logical categories with detailed context information, so that I can focus on specific types of issues and understand exactly where and how to fix them.

**Why this priority**: Improves developer experience by organizing validation results logically and providing actionable context, building on the basic validation functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering validations across different rule categories and verifying that results are properly categorized with relevant context details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** code with issues across multiple categories, **When** validation is executed, **Then** results are grouped by categories like "type_safety", "security", "performance", "code_style" with clear category identification
2. **Given** a validation failure with location information available, **When** the validation result is generated, **Then** the details field contains file path, line number, column number, and suggested fixes
3. **Given** successful rule validations, **When** validation results are generated, **Then** positive feedback is provided with category context and confirmation of what passed

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a rule fails to execute due to syntax errors or missing dependencies?
- How does the system handle rules that produce no validation results (no applicable code)?
- What occurs when validation details exceed reasonable size limits?
- How are validation results handled when file location information is unavailable?
- What happens when the same rule produces multiple validation results for different locations?
