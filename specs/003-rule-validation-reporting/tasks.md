# Tasks: Rule Validation Reporting System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-rule-validation-reporting/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution - 85% minimum coverage with stochastic testing required for non-deterministic components.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `code_review/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths use existing project structure for backward compatibility

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for enhanced rule validation

- [ ] T001 Verify existing project dependencies support enhanced schema requirements (Python 3.10+, pydantic)
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure test environment with pytest, coverage.py, and hypothesis for property-based testing
- [ ] T003 [P] Set up backward compatibility validation framework to ensure zero breaking changes

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core schema enhancements that all user stories depend on

- [ ] T004 [Foundation] Add SeverityLevel enum to `code_review/schemas.py` with values: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- [ ] T005 [Foundation] Add RuleCategory enum to `code_review/schemas.py` with categories: TYPE_SAFETY, CODE_STYLE, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, DOCUMENTATION, TESTING, DEPENDENCIES, COMPLEXITY, GENERAL
- [ ] T006 [Foundation] Enhance existing RulesResult class in `code_review/schemas.py` to add category and severity fields with backward compatibility
- [ ] T007 [Foundation] Add backward compatibility property `level` to RulesResult class for existing code
- [ ] T008 [Foundation] Add utility methods `is_violation()` and `is_blocking()` to RulesResult class
- [ ] T009 [Foundation] Create comprehensive backward compatibility test suite in `tests/unit/test_enhanced_rules_result.py`

**Checkpoint**: Enhanced RulesResult schema ready with full backward compatibility

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Enhanced Rule Validation Feedback (Priority P1)

**Checkpoint**: Severity-based filtering working for CI/CD integration

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Rule Categorization and Context (Priority P3)

**Story Goal**: Organize validation results by logical categories with detailed context information

**Independent Test**: Validation results properly categorized with relevant context details including location and remediation guidance

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup and Foundation (required for all stories)
2. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 (P1) - Enhanced Rule Validation Feedback
3. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 (P2) - Severity-Based Filtering (depends on US1)
4. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 (P3) - Rule Categorization (depends on US1)
5. **Phase 6**: Polish and Cross-Cutting Concerns (depends on all user stories)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
- Tasks T010-T013 (all test files) can run in parallel
- Tasks T014-T017 can run sequentially (same files)
- Tasks T018-T020 (integration tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Within User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
- Tasks T021-T024 (all test files) can run in parallel
- Tasks T025-T028 can run sequentially (dependent on each other)
- Tasks T029-T031 (integration tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Within User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- Tasks T032-T035 (all test files) can run in parallel
- Tasks T036-T039 can run sequentially (dependent on each other)
- Tasks T040-T042 (integration tests) can run in parallel after implementation

**Cross-Cutting (Phase 6)**:
- Tasks T043-T048 can run in parallel (different files/concerns)
- Tasks T049-T050 must run sequentially after all implementation complete

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Minimum Viable Product)
- **Foundation + User Story 1 only**: Enhanced RulesResult with categorization and severity levels
- **Delivery**: Core validation feedback enhancement with backward compatibility
- **Value**: Immediate improvement to validation result structure and coverage analysis

### Incremental Delivery
1. **Sprint 1**: Foundation + US1 (Enhanced validation feedback)
2. **Sprint 2**: US2 (Severity-based filtering for CI/CD)
3. **Sprint 3**: US3 (Category organization and detailed context)
4. **Sprint 4**: Polish and performance optimization

### Success Criteria per User Story
- **US1**: Enhanced RulesResult objects contain category, severity, and work with coverage analysis
- **US2**: Validation results can be filtered by severity with 100% accuracy for CI/CD integration
- **US3**: Validation results organized by category with detailed context for developer actionability

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Comprehensive test suite ensures existing code continues working
- **Performance**: Property-based testing with hypothesis validates large dataset handling
- **Integration**: Integration tests verify compatibility with existing CLI and reporting systems
