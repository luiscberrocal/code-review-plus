# Feature Specification: Coverage Comparison Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to run coverage in a project by moving to it (cd) chekout the master bramch. Run test coverage with a minimum coverga and count the tests. The checout the code review branch (for example featere/new_schema) and run test coverage with a minimum coverate. The idea is to check the the minimum coverage has not gone down and to make sure that an x amount of tests have been added. For example if the master branch coverage is 85% wiht 100 tests wen want the code review branch to keep 85% or more but also have more tests an x amount that should be both configurable globally or by project."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Coverage Comparison (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to verify that their feature branch maintains the same test coverage percentage as the main branch and has added new tests before submitting a pull request. They run a single command that switches between branches, runs coverage analysis on both, and provides a clear pass/fail result.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that prevents test coverage regression, which is essential for maintaining code quality in any Python project. Without this, teams cannot enforce coverage standards during code reviews.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the tool on a repository with two branches having different test coverage percentages and test counts, and verifying it correctly identifies coverage differences and test count changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a repository with master branch at 85% coverage with 100 tests, **When** checking a feature branch with 87% coverage and 105 tests, **Then** the tool reports success and shows coverage improvement and test addition details
2. **Given** a repository with master branch at 85% coverage with 100 tests, **When** checking a feature branch with 80% coverage and 95 tests, **Then** the tool reports failure for both coverage decline and test count reduction
3. **Given** a repository with master branch at 85% coverage with 100 tests, **When** checking a feature branch with 85% coverage and 102 tests, **Then** the tool reports success for maintaining coverage and adding tests

---

### User Story 2 - Configurable Coverage Thresholds (Priority: P2)

A team lead wants to configure coverage requirements per project or globally, setting minimum coverage percentages and minimum test count increases that must be met for pull requests to pass automated checks.

**Why this priority**: Different projects may have different quality standards and legacy constraints. Configuration flexibility allows the tool to adapt to various team requirements and project contexts.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting different configuration values (coverage thresholds, test count requirements) and verifying the tool respects these settings when evaluating branches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a global configuration requiring 90% coverage and 5 new tests, **When** checking any project, **Then** the tool applies these global standards
2. **Given** a project-specific configuration overriding global settings to require 80% coverage and 2 new tests, **When** checking that specific project, **Then** the tool applies the project-specific standards
3. **Given** no configuration exists, **When** running the tool, **Then** it uses reasonable defaults (maintain current coverage, require at least 1 new test)

---

### User Story 3 - Detailed Coverage Reports (Priority: P3)

A developer wants to see detailed information about coverage changes, including which files gained or lost coverage, test count breakdowns by test type, and actionable recommendations for improving coverage.

**Why this priority**: While pass/fail results are essential, detailed reporting helps developers understand what changed and how to fix coverage issues. This is valuable but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the tool on branches with known coverage differences and verifying the detailed report includes file-level coverage changes, test categorization, and improvement suggestions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a feature branch with coverage changes in specific files, **When** generating a detailed report, **Then** the tool shows per-file coverage deltas with specific line coverage details
2. **Given** a feature branch with new test files, **When** generating a detailed report, **Then** the tool categorizes tests by type (unit, integration, etc.) and shows count increases per category
3. **Given** a feature branch with coverage below threshold, **When** generating a detailed report, **Then** the tool provides specific recommendations for files that need more test coverage

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the master branch doesn't exist or is named differently (main, develop)?
- How does the system handle projects without existing test coverage configuration?
- What happens when test discovery fails or coverage analysis crashes?
- How does the tool behave when branch switching fails due to uncommitted changes?
- What happens when the repository is in a detached HEAD state?
- How does the tool handle projects with multiple test runners or coverage tools?
